/*
 * Liskov Substitution Principle
    “Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the correctness of the program.”

If S is a subclass of T, then anywhere you use a T, you should be able to use an S without the program misbehaving.
A subclass must honor the contract of the base class.
