Behavioral patterns define how objects interact, communicate, and share responsibilities.

“Design an event notification system” → Observer
“Switch between algorithms at runtime” → Strategy
“Undo/Redo functionality” → Command / Memento
“Handle requests in a chain” → Chain of Responsibility
“Change behavior as state changes” → State
